# Sharpe Ratio Demo

Description: This repository provides an analysis of the Sharpe ratio and its applicability in investment and portfolio management. The Sharpe ratio is a widely used measure of risk-adjusted return, which considers the excess return of a portfolio over a risk-free rate per unit of volatility.

The repository includes Python code for calculating the Sharpe ratio, along with comparison between amazon and facebook against the s&p 500 to show its application.
