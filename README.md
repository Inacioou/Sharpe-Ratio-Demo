# Sharpe Ratio Demo

## Description 
This repository provides an analysis of the Sharpe ratio and its applicability in investment and portfolio management. The Sharpe ratio is a widely used measure of risk-adjusted return, which considers the excess return of a portfolio over a risk-free rate per unit of volatility.

The repository includes Python code for calculating the Sharpe ratio, along with comparison between amazon and facebook against the s&p 500 to show its application.

## Conclusion
The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return per unit of risk, so a higher Sharpe ratio indicates a better risk-adjusted return. Based on the above output, we can see that Amazon has a higher Sharpe ratio than Facebook over the 252-day period. Both stocks have positive Sharpe ratios, indicating that they outperformed the risk-free rate (which I assumed to be 0) and had a positive risk premium. Moreover, both stocks have a higher Sharpe ratio than the S&P 500, which suggests that they provided a better risk-adjusted return than the market. However, we need to be cautious in interpreting these results, as the Sharpe ratio is sensitive to the choice of the risk-free rate and the sample period.
